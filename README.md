# 100-days-of-code

I am currently working through Angela Yu's [100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). 

This repo is a collection of my projects from this course. 

The premise of the challange is to code for at least 1 hour for 100 days straight. This consistency in imperative for learning something new. As someone new to coding, doing this challange in a guided format is extremely appealing. 

Background: 
I have been in the business intelligence world for 10+ years. My bread and butter is SQL + visualization tools. In an effort to become more well-rounded and push myself, I have set out to learn python. Hosting my work in GitHub additionally allows for more practice and familiarity with Git. 

My career goal is to eventually move from a Business Intelligence Engineer role into a Data Engineer role.
