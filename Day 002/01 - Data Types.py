#Instructions

#Write a program that adds the digits in a 2 digit number. e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8

#Warning. Do not change the code on line 1. Your program should work for different inputs. e.g. any two-digit number.

#The last line of your program should print the result.
#Example 1 Input

#39
#Example 1 Output

#12


two_digit_number = input()
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
####################################
# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

first_number = two_digit_number[0]
second_number = two_digit_number[1]
added_together = int(first_number) + int(second_number)
print(added_together)
